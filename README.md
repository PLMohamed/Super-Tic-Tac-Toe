# Super Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to Super Tic-Tac-Toe! This is an extended version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play on a larger grid consisting of 9 smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards. The goal is to win the smaller boards and ultimately dominate the entire grid.

## Installation

### Windows

1. Download the latest release setup.exe file from the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/super-tic-tac-toe/releases) page.
2. Run the setup.exe file and follow the installation instructions.
3. Once the installation is complete, you can find and run Super Tic-Tac-Toe in your Start Menu.

## How to Play

Each smaller board contains 9 cells arranged in a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking a cell with their symbol ('X' or 'O'). To win a smaller board, a player must have 3 of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is won by claiming 3 smaller boards in a row, again either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

- **Super Grid**: Play on a 9x9 grid consisting of 9 smaller 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe boards.
- **Alternate Turns**: Players take turns marking cells with their symbols.
- **Dynamic Board Activation**: Only active smaller boards can be played. Winning a smaller board activates the corresponding cell on the super grid.
- **Reset Game**: Click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game at any time.

## How to Reset the Game

To reset the game and start a new match, simply click the "Reset Game" button above the game grid. This will clear all the cells and allow you to begin a fresh game with Player 1 starting as 'X'.
